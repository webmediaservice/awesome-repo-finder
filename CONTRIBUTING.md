- ✅ **Active** - Last commit within 6 months (some exceptions for stable projects)
- ✅ **Documented** - Clear README with installation and usage instructions
- ✅ **Functional** - You've tested it and it works
- ✅ **Relevant** - Fits into one of our existing categories

#### Preferred Criteria
- ⭐ **Popular** - At least 50 stars (we may make exceptions for new but promising projects)
- 🍴 **Community** - Multiple contributors and active issues/PRs
- 📝 **Quality** - Well-written code and documentation
- 🔒 **Secure** - No known security vulnerabilities

**Repository Name:** [Name with link]
**Category:** [AI Tools / Developer Productivity / Business Automation]
**Stars:** [Current count]
**Last Updated:** [Month Year]

**Conflicts with existing entries:** None / [List any similar tools already on the list]
```

---

## Quality Guidelines

### ✅ Good Candidates

**Yes, definitely suggest these:**
- Well-maintained projects with active communities
- Projects solving real, common problems
- Tools with excellent documentation
- Projects that are the "best in class" for their use case
- Innovative or unique approaches to known problems

**Example:**
> "n8n - A workflow automation tool that's actively maintained, has 40k+ stars, excellent docs, and is used by thousands of businesses as a self-hosted Zapier alternative."

### ❌ Avoid These

**Please don't suggest:**
- Abandoned projects (no activity in 1+ years)
- Projects without proper documentation
- Your own projects (without disclosure and exceptional quality)
- Forks without significant improvements over the original
- Projects with known security issues
- Commercial tools without open source code
- Projects that duplicate functionality of an already-listed better tool

### 🤔 Edge Cases

**Discuss first if:**
- The project is newer than 6 months but shows great promise
- It's your own project (disclose this clearly)
- It has fewer than 50 stars but is uniquely valuable
- The license is somewhat restrictive but still open source
- It duplicates functionality of a listed tool but has significant advantages
